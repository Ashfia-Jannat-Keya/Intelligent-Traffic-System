# 4-Way Traffic System in Proteus 
A Proteus based project with C and Arduino
This system is designed to control vehicular movement and assisting pedestrians crossing as well as detecting if any accidents have taken place.
1.	The traffic lights will provide instructions to the users (drivers and pedestrians) by displaying lights of standard color. The three colors used in traffic lights are Red, Yellow, and Green.
2.	With an interruptible push button and motion sensor traffic signal will turn red only when there is some presence of pedestrians waiting to cross. When the sensor senses motion or the push-button is pushed, it interrupts the normal sequence of the traffic control and thus starts the pedestrian crossing cycle for a predetermined period. This, therefore, allows people to cross the road.
3.	The sound sensor will detect if any accidents have taken place then it will turn the red light on to avoid more car crashes. To alert the people an alarm system is also implemented with a buzzer.
